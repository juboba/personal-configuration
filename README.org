* Personal Configuration

[[https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg]]

This is my personal configuration. It's currently a mess in progress.

** OS Config
Since I use NixOS, my OS config is managed by [[./nixos/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]].

** User Config
I'm currently migrating all of my configurations to [[./nixpkgs/home.nix][home.nix]] by using
[[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] since it's easily reproduce-able and I can have everything in the
same format and place.

My config is mainly:
- Packages to install
- Shell aliases
- Various dotfiles
- Overlays to further customize packages

** My Desktop
*** My session applications
   These are applications that run together with Xmonad to make up my
   personalised Desktop Environment.

   - Mouse gestures                  :fusuma
   - Compositioning for X11          :picom
   - Notification daemon             :dunst
   - Simple system tray              :trayer
   - Network Manager applet for tray :nm-applet

*** Applications
   - Browser:              Firefox, Qutebrowser
   - Work Browser:         Chrome
   - Development Browser:  [[https://github.com/juboba/scripts/blob/master/devium][Devium]]
   - Terminal:             alacritty
   - Terminal multiplexer: tmux
   - PDF Viewer:           zathura
   - File manager:         ranger

*** Global Key mappings
See [[./nixpkgs/dotfiles/xmonad.hs::146][xmonad.hs]]

* To do's
** TODO Add home-manager configuration as a NixOS module
** TODO Create modules to group sets of configuration that go together
