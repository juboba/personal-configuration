* Personal Configuration

This is my personal configuration. It's currently a mess in progress.

** OS Config
Since I use NixOS, my OS config is managed by [[./nixos/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]].

** User Config
I'm currently migrating all of my configurations to [[./nixpkgs/home.nix][home.nix]] by using
[[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] since it's easily reproduce-able and I can have everything in the
same format and place.

My config is mainly:
- Packages to install
- Shell aliases
- Various dotfiles
- Overlays to further customize packages
